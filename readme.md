This is a Simple phone book created using Python

it can create an user and there details such as user's name , user's email and
also multiple phone numbers of the user

User's information can also be deleted or edited later after creation

Also deleting a user entirely is also added

A comprehensive view system is also added to view the entire phone book

it is stored in a dictionary so it will be deleted once exiting from the program

Hope you guys like it ...
Have fun playing around the code !!!
